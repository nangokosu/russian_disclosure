This scrape is executed via Python's scrapy. To start, you will need to install scrapy and scrapy_splash. Navigate to the spiders subfolder. From there, navigate to the Jupyter notebook. To run the scrapy spider, navigate to the other Jupyter notebook containing a cell for running the command prompt order for running the spider. The scrape will take a decent amount of time, so I would recommend running it in the background. Adjustments to the scraping settings for scrapy can be made via the settings.py file. Once that is done, the rest of that notebook is for cleaning the output from the spider.
